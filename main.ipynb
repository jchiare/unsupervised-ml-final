    "# Step 2 - Identify an Unsupervised Learning Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "For categorizing / labelling a relatively large amount (100+) customer support help center articles, we will use Topic Modelling (and most likely Latent Dirichlet Allocation) as the unsupervised learning algorithm because we don't have labels on the existing customer support help center articles. In addition, we are an external team, so we won't have the knowledge needed to manually label the data. Some other reasons we will use that unsupervised learning algorithm:\n",
    "* It can discover latent features well within a collection of documents.\n",
    "* Topic Modelling works well with unstructured text.\n",
    "* It can handle new and update help center articles well - since the information on a support help center changes often, we want a scalable solution. \n",
    "* It is also flexible, and will be able to find latent features in any new informmation that is provided in the help center articles. \n",
    "* It can condense the high dimensionaility of words into a lower dimension topics, which will make it easier to analyze the overall themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a supervised machine learning algorithm is not ideal because we don't have labelled data and we want this solution to be scalable. We want to be able to handle new topics without needing to re-fit or label our data - otherwise a supervised algorithm will be considered overfit if we don't re-train the model when new topics or themes in the support help center are introduced."
